# Project Overview 
- Here I created a site using multiple UI patterns and then populated the page with information from IMDB API.
- The page allows you to scroll through the top 50 films on from IMDB and provides click-able movie posters. Clicking the posters displays a modal with the title, name of actors, and a brief description of the plot.

## Thought Process
- My process was intially to build a basic form of the page and make sure it was functional with the information form the API. I then made sure that my UI elements were present with the information from the API and proceeded with styling.

## MVP & Post MVP

### MVP
- Pick one UI Pattern and one API and combine the two.
- The data to populate the UI Pattern should come from the API.
- When the user loads the page, they should see the data from the API load into the UI pattern on the screen.

### Post MVP
- Added horizontally scrollable UI and Modals as UI patterns.

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js
